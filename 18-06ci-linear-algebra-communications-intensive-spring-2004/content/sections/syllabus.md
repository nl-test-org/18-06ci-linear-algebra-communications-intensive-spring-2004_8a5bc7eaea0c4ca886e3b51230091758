Description
-----------

This course is a communication intensive supplement to Linear Algebra, [18.06](/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2005). We will go over the 18.06 syllabus, considering some topics in more depth. The main emphasis will be on the methods of creating rigorous and elegant proofs and presenting them clearly in writing.

Recommended Text

The class will meet once a week for an hour, and additionally for half an hour in smaller groups. We hope to have at least one class in a computer lab working with the publishing program LaTeX.

There will be weekly written assignments and a final paper, which should be about five printed pages long. Time allowing, each student will make a presentation in class on the subject of their final paper. There is no final exam.

Grading

The grade will be based half on mathematics and half on writing.
